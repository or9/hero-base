#Card Game  
Using Laravel for this simple app is like driving nails with a 20 lb sledgehammer. It's fulfilling and makes you strong.  

##Required Software
* PHP  
* Composer  
* Laravel  

##Initial Setup
### SSL
In order to successfully use an SSL setup, you may wish to use MariaDB rather than MySQL for local development.  
Create SSL certs following this guide, https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/creating-ssl-certs.html  
### Tables
Create a new MySQL schema called `cards`. This will hold the application's tables.  
Create a user, `webapp` with all permissions (except grant privileges; they are not required) on the `cards` schema. This user does not require access to any other schemas.  
```
composer update
composer install
cp .env.example .env  
php artisan migrate  
php artisan db:seed  
```
###Start
```
php artisan serve
```

##Troubleshooting  
###General  
`composer dump-autoload`  

###Arch Linux...
```
sudo vim /usr/share/php-composer/php.ini
extension=mcrypt.so  
extension=pdo_mysql.so  
extension=pthreads.so  
extension_dir="/usr/lib/php/modules/"
```
